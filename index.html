Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. You mean it controls your actions? Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. What!? Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you.

Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. What!? I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base.

You don't believe in the Force, do you? I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan-- He is here. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.
