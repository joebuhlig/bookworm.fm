Mike&rsquo;s statement about the book:</p>
<p>Why do we read books? Is it to learn how to do new things? Is it to be inspired by the actions of others? Is it simply to be entertained? I believe we read books for the experience. A good book, even a non-fiction book, takes you on a journey. It tells you a story, and evokes an emotion. A good book does not just speak at you, but it speaks to you. It challenges and motivates you. It makes you wrestle with the question of what would YOU do if you were placed in a similar situation. Would you have the courage to act heroically and save the day? Or would you give in to the pressure, the problems, and the pain? But the best books encourage you that it is at least possible for you to act heroically, that you at least have a chance to make the shot, rescue the princess, or save the day.</p>
<p>This book does just that, but I&rsquo;m not even sure how. It&rsquo;s not a work of fiction, but at times you wish it was. What I have difficulty comprehending is <em>how</em> Victor Frankly is able to maintain a positive attitude and a will to live in the circumstances that he describes. I&rsquo;d like to think that I&rsquo;d be able to act the same way - to help those who are suffering around me - but I&rsquo;m not qualified to make such a statement. I can only hope and pray for that kind of strength, but Victor shows us that it is at least <em>possible</em>.</p>
<p>Not often do I find myself with nothing to say in response to an author, but that is indeed the case here. I am not qualified to challenge any of this great man&rsquo;s opinions; I can only shut up and listen to what he has to say. And he has earned that right, to speak freely and to have those who are not tested in the fire of adversity pay attention. This is one of the best books I have ever read, and believe that everyone should read this. I am humbled and challenged to do better in my responses to my &ldquo;problems,&rdquo; even if they are insignificant compared to what Victor Frankl went through.</p>
