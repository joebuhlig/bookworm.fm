<p>This&nbsp;AppleScript and service will give you a prompt hourly: "What are you working on?" Your response to that question will be logged to Day One for you to review later.</p>
<p>The intent is to&nbsp;generate a record of your actions to look back on and can be used to reveal your procrastination habits. This was originally discussed on <a href="https://bookworm.fm/19/">episode 19 (5m 57s)</a>.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, this will use the Day One CLI combined with an Automator service and&nbsp;AppleScript. So it will require some light installation. But no fear. The full documentation of how to download and install the necessary components are included in the build of this structure.</p>
<p><!-- Code is poetry --></p>
